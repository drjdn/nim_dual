Dual Numbers Library
====================

This repository contains a dual number implemention in
[Nim](https://nim-lang.org).  See the API
[documentation](https://nimble.directory/docs/dual//dual/dual.html) for
more information.  It hasn't been super well tested as I haven't used it
extensively and hence the 0.1.0 designation.  There isn't much to it however and
outside of typos it should function as intended.  Please submit issues if you
find a bug.

If you have no idea what dual numbers are I've provided a brief
[introduction](https://github.com/drjdn/ocaml_dual/blob/master/dual_numbers.pdf).

Installation
------------

As long as you have a recent version of [nimble](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble) you
can install as follows:
```bash
$ nimble install dual
```
